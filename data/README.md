The dataset used is hecluster-trace-gpu-v2023 from alibaba.
A fork can be found [here](https://github.com/AntonJoha/clusterdata/blob/master/cluster-trace-gpu-v2023/csv/openb_pod_list_default.csv)

It is free to use for study and research.
I've purposefully excluded the files themselves from this repo.
